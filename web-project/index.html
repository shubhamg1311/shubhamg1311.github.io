            <p>          Trees produces oxygen that is life line of all living beings. In the hot summer we usually plan trips in
the hilly areas. But if the rate of cutting Trees remains same then we don’t have enough Trees to plan
a trip, seasonal raining and amount of fresh oxygen will no longer be available. <strong>Trees helps to clean
the air, soil and water, making the earth a beautiful livable place. Living close to trees makes us
healthier and happier. Its time to SAVE Trees, protect forests and spread awareness. If you want to
save trees, you can help by protecting those that grow around your home, and planting more Trees.</strong>
Reduce the use of paper products, too. According to our little understanding we have found few
ways to protect Trees, you can also follow them ,motivate your friends and family members to join
hands together to save our beautiful earth or you can join an organization working to save Tress
around your home town.</p>
		<font color="red"><h3 class="heading">SAVE TREES AROUND YOU</h3></font>
		<P>         Every town and city has laws dictating which tree species need to be protected and when and how
it’s OK to cut down trees. In some areas, trees that are delicate, rare or extremely beneficial are 
protected by law. <strong>Knowing the laws in your area will help you be a better advocate for the trees there.</strong></P>
		<font color="red"><h3 class="heading"> WHAT YOU CAN DO TO SAVE THE TREES</h3></font>
		<P>            Speak up to save the tree, rather than just letting it get cut down. Get together with other people who
care about saving trees in your area and make it clear that you object to cutting down healthy trees.
Even if there’s no law against cutting down the tree, if enough people think trees are important and
need to be protected, you might be able to create change. Even if it’s too late for this particular tree,
you’ll set a precedent for next time. <strong>Here are a few things you can do: • Write a letter of objection to
your city forester or city council member. • Start a petition to change policies or protect certain trees.
Rally neighbors to get involved in saving the neighborhood trees. • Get the media involved by
sending a letter to the editor or contacting a local TV station.</strong></P>
		<font color="red"><h3 class="heading">PARTICIPATE IN TREE PLANTATION</h3></font>
		<P>          As important as it is to protect mature trees, it’s also essential to think ahead and plant new trees that
will eventually get tall enough to contribute to the canopy, clean the air and help keep temperatures
cool. Many towns and cities have organizations like Portland, Oregon’s Friends of Trees[5] working
to plant trees in areas that have too few. <i>If your town or city doesn’t have a similar organization, why
not start one yourself?</i> <strong>Tree by tree, you can make a difference. </strong>• The type of tree you plant matters.
Talk with an arborist about which species are native to your area and will eventually get big enough
to clean the air and water. Small, ornamental trees won’t contribute much. • Buying trees can get
expensive. See if there’s a nursery nearby that shares your views on trees and could give your group 
a discount on baby trees.</P>

            <font color="red"><h3 class="heading">REDUCE PAPER USE</h3></font>
            <p>            Reducing your use of paper products in order to save trees can seem abstract, since you never see the
trees that get turned into items like paper towels and napkins. But it’s important to start seeing the
connection between the trees you love and the products you use, since somewhere trees where cut
down, processed into pulp, bleached and pressed into the shape of tissues you can use to blow your
nose on. <strong>If you’re passionate about saving trees, look for ways to use fewer paper products in your
daily life • Use cloth towels instead of paper towels. It’s a simple change that can reduce a lot of
unnecessary waste. • Use cloth napkins instead of paper napkins. They’re more elegant, anyway. •
Use handkerchiefs instead of tissues. It might take some getting used to, but handkerchiefs are
actually softer on your skin than tissues, so you might like them better. • Use reusable containers
instead of paper lunch bags. • If you must use a paper product, always buy the recycled version. At
least you’ll know it’s not made from virgin pulp.</strong> Choose the paperless options for bills. This simple 
switch will make your life less cluttered and reduce the number of dead trees on your conscience. If
you still get paper bills sent to your house, go online and make the switch to the paperless option.
You can opt to receive notifications that a bill is due via email, rather than having to check the mail.</p>

            <p>            Forests in Brazil, Russia, Canada and other parts of the world are being cut down or burned by forest
fires every day. 78 million acres of rainforest are lost every single year. Scientists posit that if forest
destruction continues at this rate, 80 to 90 percent of rain forests will by gone by 2022. Since forests
play an essential part in keeping our planet healthy, stopping their destruction can’t happen soon
enough. • Most forests are destroyed to provide space for agriculture or developments, to provide
wood for paper products, or by forest fires that have increased in severity since the advent of global
warming. • Saving forests must be a global effort, but there are things you can do to contribute, even
if you live nowhere near a rain forest. Share your love for trees and forests with other people.
Showing those in your life that you care about trees is a good way to help other people start taking
action, too. Many people simply don’t realize how important old growth forests are to the health of
the planet, including its human population. The more people who understand and care, the more
likely destructive practices will be brought to a halt. • Spread the word on social media. When you
see a story related to the state of the earth’s forest, share what you think about it and encourage
others to comment. • Show that standing up for trees is something you believe in. Since saving trees
will require a change in lifestyle, some people oppose the idea. By making it clear that saving trees is
something you believe is valuable, you’ll be acting as a role model to others.</p>
              <font color="red"> <h3 class="heading">DONATE TO A NONPROFIT WORKING TO SAVE FORESTS</h3></font>
		<p>         There are many nonprofits dedicated to saving forests across the world, and they are all in need of
donations. Find one you trust and consider making a donation. • For example:<strong>Donate our organisation, your donation will save the <i>GREEN PLANET.</i></strong></p>
